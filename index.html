	      <h3> Description </h3>
              <p>
              Automorphic forms are present in almost every area of modern
              number theory. In recent decades there has been a starburst of
              activity and progress in this broad area, leading to many new and
              exciting directions, applications, and connections with other
              areas. This is a rapidly expanding area, with numerous
              approaches, tools, and interconnections, as well as connections
              to other areas of mathematics. The Building Bridges research
              school offers training to graduate students and early career
              researchers in areas of automorphic forms and related topics that
              continue to be the foci of exciting and influential research
              activity. The five-day workshop immediately following the summer
              school aims to foster and strengthen a long-lasting, friendly and
              supportive exchange between automorphic forms researchers in the
              EU and the US, and to integrate the summer school students into
              this community. The organizers have obtained funding to subsidize
              the costs of successful applicants to the summer school.
              </p>

              <p>
              The <a href="school.html">research school</a> aims provide
              graduate students and early career researchers with training on
              some topics that are having great impact on current research in
              automorphic forms. The school takes place in the first week of
              the meeting, and will be comprised of three 2-day intensive
              mini-courses, each team-taught by a pair of experts, and
              supplemented by afternoon problem sessions.
              </p>

              <p>
              The <a href="workshop.html">workshop</a>, which takes place in
              the second week of the meeting, aims to foster and strengthen a
              long-lasting exchange between automorphic forms researchers in
              the EU and the US.  The focus includes all areas of research
              related to automorphic forms.  Like previous meetings, particular
              effort will be made to generate and sustain a friendly,
              supportive atmosphere, providing encouragement to young
              researchers, mentoring opportunities for more established
              researchers.
